**nnplot** is a Python library for visualizing Neural Networks in an informative representation. 

It has the ability to display the NN's structure, dominance of links weights per layer and their polarity (positive/negative).

It also provides functions for pruning the NN in order to display the **n** “most important” nodes of each layer.
