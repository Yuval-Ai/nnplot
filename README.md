**nnplot** is a Python library for visualizing Neural Networks in an informative representation. 

It has the ability to display the NN's structure, dominance of links weights per layer and their polarity (positive/negative).

It also provides functions for pruning the NN in order to display the **n** “most important” nodes of each layer.

## How to install it?

nnplot is available via pip:

```bash
  pip install nnplot
```
/TODO - dependencies?

*alternatively, you can download the *nnplot*  subfolder and place it in the same directory of your code. 


## How to use it?
once you have a built and trained Keras module, you can simply:

plot the module:

```python
\TODO code...
```

or prune the module:

```python
\TODO code...
```



To make the most out of the functions mentioned above, try using their optional flags:

plot:

```python
\TODO code...
```

prune:

```python
\TODO code...
```

#### Examples:

##### 1. plot <\TODO - with something>:

```python
\TODO code...
```

**result:** 

\TODO - Image 

##### 2. plot <\TODO - with something>:

```python
\TODO code...
```

**result:** 

\TODO - Image 

##### 3. plot <\TODO - with something>:

```python
\TODO code...
```

**result:** 

\TODO - Image 

##### 4. plot <\TODO - with something>:

```python
\TODO code...
```

**result:** 

\TODO - Image
